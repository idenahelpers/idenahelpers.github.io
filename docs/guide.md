## Everything to know to become validator
***
Idena is a blockchain network based on *Proof of Personhood*.

Idena is **not** an identity provider, nor a stamp provider for Gitcoin passport.
Gitcoin includes a stamp for Idena validators, as Idena is highly *anti-sybil* and its system guarantees uniqueness and personhood.

The core part of Idena is *validation*, that happens every *epoch*: it's a worldwide syncronised ceremony where everyone is at the same time validator and validatee.
