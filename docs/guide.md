# Getting started to Idena

### Idena basics – part I

Audience identity status: *Not validated*

## How to become a validator

Idena is a blockchain network based on *Proof of Personhood*.

Idena is **not** an identity provider, nor a stamp provider for Gitcoin passport.
Gitcoin includes a stamp for Idena validators, as Idena is highly *anti-sybil* and its system guarantees uniqueness and personhood.

The core part of Idena is *validation*, that happens every *epoch*: it's a worldwide syncronised ceremony where everyone is at the same time validator and validatee.

***

During validation you are assigned a random number of *flip* puzzles of 4 images each, that are made by other validators during the ending epoch. Validation is divided in 3 parts: *short* session, *long* (or qualification) session and *reporting* session.

Short session is to make sure that you don't try validating multiple identities: if you don't submit in time it will result as a *late submission*, and you won't pass validation.

In both short and long session the task is to solve the flip puzzles by choosing the right order of the images between two possibilities.

Reporting session consists of judging the flips and reporting bad flips, given the two *keywords* that the flip must include, that means:

* keywords not present — both must be there
* impossible flips  —  no sense at all, or multiple storylines, or flip that makes sense in both orders, or with some text necessary to solve the flip (remember that people worldwide understand different languages)
* bot-friendly flips  —  numerated images (numbers or letters that tell the right order), enumerated objects in progression, template beginning or ending image (as waking up at the beginning, or thumb up at the end)
* template flips  —  recycled or reusable flips, as a flip with both keywords shown in – e.g. – a picture or a box
* NSFW content

To learn how to validate, open the training page of the web app, at [app.idena.io/try](https://app.idena.io/try), where you can find a detailed tutorial, and three levels of *training* (easy, medium, and hard), that differ not in content but in the waiting time, to train organising to be ready in time for validating.

Successful training gives a *certificate* that can be shared with the [Idena community](https://docs.idena.io/docs/community/channels) to let them *invite* you for the next validation ceremony. Getting good scores is crucial, as a poor short/long score would not guarantee passing that validation, and a poor reporting would penalise people wrongly reported during real validations, or make bad flips pass as good.
